# Vulkan.c3

Vulkan bindings for C3 language

Currently at very early stage, api will change often.

### Examples

To see examples install https://c3-lang.org/ and then run `c3c run cube` in this repository

### Roadmap

* Get C3 error handling working with vulkan
* Get MacOS and Windows examples working.
* Build vulkan xml parser in C3 instead of Dart
